# Tennessee Department of Health COVID-19 Data
These datasets are pulled nightly from the Tennesee Department of Health (TDH) website at https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/downloadable-datasets.html. They are then converted them from xlsx format to csv using the python xlsx2csv utility (full script [here](https://bitbucket.org/mtnaus/covid-19/src/master/tools/covid19-scraper/scripts/xlsxDownload.sh)), and the resulting csv files are added to this directory.
The metadata for each of these datasets is taken from the provided data dictionary file, which is also pulled nightly from the TN DOH website. 

## Original TDH datasets are structured as follows:

## Data Curation & Transformation

### Age

The following cleansing operations have been performed on the source age file:

- The variables have been renamed to align with the standard variable names we are using across the data sets:
	- `DATE` -> `date_stamp` 
	- `AGE_RANGE` -> `age_group` 
	- `AR_CASECOUNT` -> `cnt_confirmed` 
	- `AR_TOTALPERCENT` -> `pct_confirmed` 
	- `NEW_ARCASES` -> `cnt_confirmed_new` 
	- `AR_NEWPERCENT` -> `pct_confirmed_new` 
	- `AR_TOTALDEATHS`  -> `cnt_death` 
	- `AR_NEWDEATHS` -> `cnt_death_new`
- The date variable has been reformatted to be an ISO 8601 date. 
- The age goup has been coded.
- The percentage of cases and percentage of new cases were multiplied by 100 in order that the values add up to 100 rather than decimals that add up to 1.0.

### County

The following cleansing operations have been performed on the source county file:

- The variables have been renamed to align with the standard variable names we are using across the data sets:
	- `DATE` -> `date_stamp`
	- `COUNTY` -> `us_county_fips`
	- `TOTAL_CASES` -> `cnt_total`
	- `NEW_CASES` -> `cnt_total_new`
	- `TOTAL_CONFIRMED` -> `cnt_confirmed`
	- `NEW_CONFIRMED` -> `cnt_confirmed_new`
	- `POS_TESTS` -> `cnt_tested_pos`
	- `NEG_TESTS` -> `cnt_tested_neg`
	- `TOTAL_TESTS` -> `cnt_tested`
	- `NEW_TESTS` -> `cnt_tested_new`
	- `NEW_DEATHS` -> `cnt_death_new`
	- `TOTAL_DEATHS` -> `cnt_death`
	- `NEW_RECOVERED` -> `cnt_recovered_new`
	- `TOTAL_RECOVERED` -> `cnt_recovered`
	- `NEW_ACTIVE` -> `cnt_active_new`
	- `TOTAL_ACTIVE` -> `cnt_active`
	- `NEW_HOSPITALIZED` -> `cnt_hospitalized_new`
	- `TOTAL_HOSPITALIZED` -> `cnt_hospitalized`
	
- The date variable has been reformatted to be an ISO 8601 date. 
- The county name has been replaced with the 5 digit FIPS county code. The 'Pending' and 'Out of State' values have been removed from this variable. 
- A new variable `tn_covid_geo` has been added. This will be the 5 digit county FIPS code and will include codes for 'Pending' and 'Out of State'.
- The total and new variables have been placed side by side in the same order. 

### Daily Case

The following cleansing operations have been performed on the source daily case file:

- The variables have been renamed to align with the standard variable names we are using across the data sets:
	- `DATE` -> `date_stamp`
	- `TOTAL_CASES` -> `cnt_total`
	- `NEW_CASES` -> `cnt_total_new`
	- `TOTAL_CONFIRMED` -> `cnt_confirmed`
	- `NEW_CONFIRMED` -> `cnt_confirmed_new`
	- `POS_TESTS` -> `cnt_tested_pos`
	- `NEG_TESTS` -> `cnt_tested_neg`
	- `TOTAL_TESTS` -> `cnt_tested`

	- `TOTAL_ACTIVE` -> `cnt_active`
	- `NEW_HOSP` -> `cnt_hospitalized_new`
	- `TOTAL_HOSP` -> `cnt_hospitalized`
- The date variable has been reformatted to be an ISO 8601 date. 
- The total and new variables have been placed side by side in the same order. 

### Race / Ethnicity / Sex

The following cleansing operations have been performed on the source daily case file:

- The variables have been renamed to align with the standard variable names we are using across the data sets:
	- `Date` -> `date_stamp` 
	- `Category` -> `category_type` 
	- `Cat_Detail` -> `category_name` 
	- `Cat_CaseCount` -> `cnt_confirmed` 
	- `Cat_Percent` -> `pct_confirmed` 
	- `CAT_DEATHCOUNT`  -> `cnt_death` 
	- `CAT_DEATHPERCENT` -> `pct_death`
- The date variable has been reformatted to be an ISO 8601 date. 
- Coded the category detail values
- The original file has been split into three separate files. We use the Category to split these out into dedicated Race, Ethnicity, and Sex files.
