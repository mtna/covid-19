# MTNA/RDS COVID-19 Project

#### _WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGE. CONTENT OR CODE SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR TESTING OR EVALUATION PURPOSES._

Our COVID-19 project focuses on improving and facilitating access to COVID-19 related data by curating the information and delivering as a through our Rich Data Services API and related web applications. Visit our COVID-19 web site at https://covid19.richdataservices.com/ for more information.

In the process of packaging the data for publication, we are commonly addressing various data quality issues surrounding the various data sources, such as:

- reshaping or reorganizing the data to be better suited for analytical purposes
- enhancing the data by adding variable/fields to faciliate linking and analysis
- rename variables to standardized names to facilitate processing and understanding
- capture metadata and documentation
- repackage the data in open format

The repository holds the various tools we use to harvest and support the above tasks along with resulting new datasets.

## Data Sources

We currently are currently harvesting and compiling data form the following data sources:

- [2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](data/us/jhu-ccse/README.md)
- [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/about-project)
- [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html)
- [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start)

## Using the Data

We have done the work of gathering and cleaning the data to power our RDS API, but it is open to the public to use however you wish. Below are some ways to interact with the data through our RDS products, which are all currently free to use.

- Use the [Tabulation Engine](https://covid19.richdataservices.com/rds-tabengine/data-product-selection) to create the tabulation you need, then copy the code to use the data in your preferred language. 
- Explore the data and metadata in the [RDS Explorer](https://covid19.richdataservices.com/rds-explorer/data-product-selection).
- Use our SDKs to integrate the RDS API into your app: 
  - JavaScript ([SDK](https://github.com/mtna/rds-js) + [Example app](https://mtna.github.io/rds-js-examples/covid.html))
  - Python ([SDK](https://github.com/mtna/rds-python) + [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mtna/rds-python-examples))
  - R ([SDK](https://github.com/mtna/rds-r) + [Example app](https://covid19.richdataservices.com/rds-rshiny/covid-19/))
- Visit our [Knowledge Base](https://mtnaus.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RDSHD/overview) to learn more, or ask a question at our [service desk](https://mtnaus.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/9)--we're happy to help.
