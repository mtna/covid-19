# MTNA/RDS COVID-19 Project

#### _WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGE. CONTENT OR CODE SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR TESTING OR EVALUATION PURPOSES._

Our COVID-19 project focuses on improving and facilitating access to COVID-19 related data by curating the information and delivering as a through our Rich Data Services API and related web applications. Visit our COVID-19 web site at http://covid-19.mtna.us for more information.

In the process of packaging the data for publication, we are commonly addressing various data quality issues surrounding the various data sources, such as:

- reshaping or reorganizing the data to be better suited for analytical purposes
- enhancing the data by adding variable/fields to faciliate linking and analysis
- rename variables to standardized names to facilitate processing and understanding
- capture metadata and documentation
- repackage the data in open format

The repository holds the various tools we use to harvest and support the above tasks along with resulting new datasets.
